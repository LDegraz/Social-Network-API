# üì± Social Network API

## üßæ Description

This project is a **Social Network API** built using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. It allows users to create an account, share their thoughts, react to other users‚Äô thoughts, and manage a friend list. Designed as a back-end solution for a social media platform, the API supports full CRUD operations for users and thoughts, as well as subdocument functionality for reactions and friend management.

The application uses **NoSQL** (MongoDB) to efficiently handle large amounts of unstructured data, a common requirement for modern social networking platforms.
